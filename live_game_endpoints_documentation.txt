# MLB StatsAPI Live Game Endpoints Documentation


## 1. Endpoint: `/api/v1.1/game/{game_pk}/feed/live`
- **Method:** GET
- **Description:** Get live game status. This API can return very large payloads. It is strongly recommended that clients ask for diffs and use the "Accept-Encoding: gzip" header.

### Path Parameters:
- `game_pk` (integer, required): Unique Primary Key Representing a Game

### Query Parameters:
- `timecode` (string, optional): Use this parameter to return a snapshot of the data at the specified time. Format: `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`
- `fields` (array of strings, optional): Intended to filter the response, but in testing, this parameter returns an empty object `{}`. It may not be supported or may require a different format.
- `inclusiveTimecode` (boolean, optional): Intended to include plays before or at the specified timecode. In testing, this parameter did not visibly alter the output.
- `accent` (boolean, optional): Intended to return names with accents. In testing, this parameter did not visibly alter the output.

### Usage Example:
```
GET /api/v1.1/game/776567/feed/live
```
- Replace `776567` with the desired game primary key.
- For large payloads, use the header: `Accept-Encoding: gzip`

#### Notes from Testing:
- The endpoint returns a detailed JSON object with game, team, player, and status info.
- The `fields` parameter does not filter the response as expected (returns `{}`).
- The `accent` and `inclusiveTimecode` parameters do not visibly change the output for this test case.

## 2. Endpoint: `/api/v1.1/game/{game_pk}/feed/live/timestamps`
- **Method:** GET
- **Description:** Retrieve all of the play timestamps for a game. This can be used for replaying games. Endpoint returns all of the timecodes that can be used with diffs for `/v1/game/{game_pk}/feed/live`.

### Path Parameters:
- `game_pk` (integer, required): Unique Primary Key Representing a Game

### Usage Example:
```
GET /api/v1.1/game/776567/feed/live/timestamps
```
- Returns a JSON array of timecode strings, e.g.:
```
[
	"20250827_183753",
	...
	"20250827_231301"
]
```

## 3. Endpoint: `/api/v1.1/game/{game_pk}/feed/live/diffPatch`
- **Method:** GET
- **Description:** Get live game status diffPatch. This endpoint allows comparison of game files and shows any differences/discrepancies between the two. 

#### Diff/Patch System Usage:
1. Request full payload by not passing `startTimecode` or `endTimecode`. This will return the most recent game state.
2. Find the latest timecode in this response.
3. Wait X seconds.
4. Use the timecode from step 2 as the `startTimecode`. This will give you a diff of everything that has happened since `startTimecode`.
5. If no data is returned, wait X seconds and do the same request.
6. If data is returned, get a new timeStamp from the response, and use that for the next call as `startTimecode`.

### Path Parameters:
- `game_pk` (integer, required): Unique Primary Key Representing a Game

### Query Parameters:
- `startTimecode` (string, optional): The starting timecode for the diff.
- `endTimecode` (string, optional): The ending timecode for the diff.

### Usage Example:
```
GET /api/v1.1/game/776567/feed/live/diffPatch?startTimecode=20250827_230753&endTimecode=20250827_231301
```
- Returns an empty array `[]` if there are no changes between the timecodes.
- If no params are provided, returns the full game state object (similar to `/feed/live`).

---


## General Notes
- All endpoints require a valid `game_pk` (game primary key) in the path.
- For large responses, use the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header to reduce payload size.
- The `fields` parameter does not appear to be supported as documented (returns `{}` in testing).
- The `accent` and `inclusiveTimecode` parameters did not visibly alter the output in this test.
- The diffPatch endpoint returns an empty array if there are no changes between the specified timecodes.
